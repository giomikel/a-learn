# A-Learn: Theoretical Computer Science Web Tools

A-Learn is a web application that provides a set of tools for working with finite automata and formal languages. It offers functionalities to create, visualize, and manipulate finite automata, as well as perform various conversions and simulations.

## Try it Out!

You can access the live demo of A-Learn at [https://giomikel.github.io/a-learn/](https://giomikel.github.io/a-learn/). Explore the tools and experiment with automata conversion and simulation.
